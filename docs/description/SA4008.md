# The variable in the loop condition never changes, are you incrementing the wrong variable?

For example:

	for i := 0; i < 10; j++ { ... }

This may also occur when a loop can only execute once because of unconditional
control flow that terminates the loop. For example, when a loop body contains an
unconditional break, return, or panic:

	func f() {
		panic("oops")
	}
	func g() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			// f unconditionally calls panic, which means "i" is
			// never incremented.
			f()
		}
	}
