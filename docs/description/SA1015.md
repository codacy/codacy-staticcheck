# Using time.Tick in a way that will leak. Consider using time.NewTicker, and only use time.Tick in tests, commands and endless functions

Before Go 1.23, time.Tickers had to be closed to be able to be garbage
collected. Since time.Tick doesn't make it possible to close the underlying
ticker, using it repeatedly would leak memory.

Go 1.23 fixes this by allowing tickers to be collected even if they weren't closed.
