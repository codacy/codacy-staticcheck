# Omit redundant nil check on slices, maps, and channels

The len function is defined for all slices, maps, and
channels, even nil ones, which have a length of zero. It is not necessary to
check for nil before checking that their length is not zero.

Before:

    if x != nil && len(x) != 0 {}

After:

    if len(x) != 0 {}
